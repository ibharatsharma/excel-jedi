# Excel Jedi
Excel Jedi is a basic utility to:
1. Write an ArrayList to an excel file
1. Read an excel file into a list of Java object

# TODO:
1. Check if file exists. If Yes, then should we delete old file? or give user a flag in the writer API to decide that?
1. Extend API to provide styling customisations
